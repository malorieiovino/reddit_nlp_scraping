# reddit_nlp_scraping
This project investigates the usage of queer slurs across three different subreddits, examining their linguistic context, performativity, and reclamation. Using web scraping (Reddit API &amp; PRAW), NLP, and collocational analysis, this study explores how slurs are used in different online spaces and how meaning shifts based on context.
