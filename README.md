# 📊 Queer Slur Analysis on Reddit  

## 📄 Project Overview  
This project investigates the usage and context of **queer slurs** across three different subreddits. Using **web scraping (Reddit API & PRAW), NLP techniques, and collocational analysis**, this study explores how slurs are used in different online spaces, focusing on **performativity, reclamation, and linguistic shifts**.

## 🔍 Research Focus  
- **Which queer slurs appear most frequently in these communities?**  
- **Are these terms used as reclaimed language or in a derogatory manner?**  
- **How do collocates (words surrounding these slurs) impact meaning?**  

## 📂 Data Collection

  - `NLTK / spaCy` for NLP processing  
- **Corpus:** Collected comments containing the terms: *queer, faggot, dyke, homo*.

## 🛠 Methods & Analysis  
- **Collocational analysis** (Word Window ±3) to examine linguistic patterns.  
- **Sentiment analysis** to assess how slurs are used in context.  
- **Frequency distributions** of slurs and common collocates.

## 📊 Results (Coming Soon)  
- Initial findings suggest [INSERT BRIEF KEY FINDINGS].
- Detailed analysis and visualization to be added.
